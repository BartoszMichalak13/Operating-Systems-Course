# Operating-Systems-Course (LSH included)
This repo will contain programs/tasks given to me on operating systems course. 

Listst cointains mostly low-level C code, some asm x86 (lista 7) and some bash scripts. 

LSH is located in folder lista5/zad3 and its called lshJOB.c (or lsh.c, but this one does not include my VERY simple implementation of Job-Control). 

Simple system monitor is located in lista4/skrypt2.sh. It is monitoring basic stats (upload, download, cpu cores usage, etc).

Note: lista6 has 3 links to simulated 4bit CPU circuit. Very often simulator breaks some wires aka puts them where their not supposed to be or deletes them. That's why given circuit may not work.
